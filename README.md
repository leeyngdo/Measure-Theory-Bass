Real Analysis for Graduate Students, Version 4.3, Richard F. Bass, 2022.
</p>

This repository comprises my notes and solutions to exercises in [Real Analysis for Graduate Students](https://bass.math.uconn.edu/real.html) by Richard F. Bass. <br>

**â€» Note** <br>
It is important to note that potential inaccuracies or erroneous solutions may exist; thus, I recommend to employ this repository just for reference purposes. Also, the author provided brief idea of solutions to most of exercises in the end of the book. You might want to refer to them first prior to my solutions.
